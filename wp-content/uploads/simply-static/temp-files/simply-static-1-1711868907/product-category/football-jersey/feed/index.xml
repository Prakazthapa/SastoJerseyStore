The shirt reinterprets the iconic colours that stand for FC Bayern’s identity. It is made of a white base tone decorated with bold, deep red sleeves – a nod to the home kit worn by the players in 1965 when Bayern were promoted to the Bundesliga. The design is completed with the words “Rot &#38; Weiß ein Leben lang” (red &#38; white for life) inside the collar alongside the motto “Mia san mia”. New FC Bayern lettering and new-look player numbers will feature on the back.]]></description>
